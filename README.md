# nn-demo-site.ku
This project-repo is the   nn-demo-site.ku   example setup of a freely hosted gh-page, 

featuring the free new-nations DNS server on http://new-nations.net

https://dimyme.github.io/nn-demo-site.ku

This is to demonstrate how it can be done, since it involves some DNS trickery which no one bothered to document anywhere near.
