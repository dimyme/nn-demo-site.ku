# nn-demo-site.ku
This project-repo is the   nn-demo-site.ku   example setup of a freely hosted gh-page, 

featuring the free new-nations DNS server on http://new-nations.net

https://dimyme.github.io/nn-demo-site.ku

This is to demonstrate how it can be done, since it involves some DNS trickery which no one bothered to document anywhere near.

setting things up on the cheap (i.e. not using our own DNS server called "knot-resolver" kresd / knotr) is done right quick:

on NN, register a subdomain  such as   thisISMYown.ku
and configure it like:


configure nn-demo-site.ku

nn-demo-site.ku to IP Address (address of your web server)
Enter IP Address (e.g. www.nn-demo-site.ku = 123.213.14.105 )
http://www.nn-demo-site.ku = 123.213.14.105

123.213.14.105 seems to be the NN DNS or something.
