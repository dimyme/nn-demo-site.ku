Always wanted to run a website on your own domain for free ?

This is a demo example of how to achive it.

We are using:

* the free github-pages to host stuff
* https://blockchain-dns.info   add-on so firefox can actually surf to  a  *.ku  website
*
*
*
*



.../docs/ is the actual hmtl file  directory   to be hosted on    http://nn-demo-site.ku

via github-pages for free

instead of static html, we use those templates by github
